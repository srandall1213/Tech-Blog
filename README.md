# Tech-Blog

## Description
My motivation in completing this project was to apply what I learned this week about MVC software design. I built this project because I wanted to test my skills and see if I could be effective in creating a Tech Blog. The Tech Blog solves the problem of getting, creating, updating, and deleting posts in the blog as well as authenticating the user. Through this project I learned more about how what goes into models, views, and controllers. I also learned how to implement Handlebars. I faced several challenges with this project. Getting all my files to communicate correctly was one of my biggest troubles. Consistency with naming things was also a challenge (I kept adding an 's' to the end of content). I got a lot of help from AskBCS. They were very helpful in teaching me understand the bugs that came up. Getting handlebars to render was something I learned to understand more fully through this process.
